Mine: I had fun adding onto this project. I struggled in some areas; however, I feel like I'm getting better at understanding what all the code actually means. I didn't have to go searching for answers as much, I just kind of talked it out and found the solution. The part I mainly struggled with was trying to change my image what the player died. I way over complicated the process. I was trying to make new functions or add a loop, when I found I could just change it like the text. I wonder how the AI will do this assignment.

AI: ChatGPT made the site look way more polished. It also added some humor into the story. It wasn't very detailed, plot wise, but it did the trick. It also added way more images and styling to the site. One thing I didn't like is how it had all the code on one file instead of multiple. It made it a little bit harder to comprehend the java, but I got there eventually.
