    <h3>A Short Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        Hi! my name is Lexi Nunnally. I'm a senior at the University of Montana.
        I'm currently studying Media Arts with a focus in animation. 
        I love movies and I've always dreamed of working behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>
        This will be my third web design/coding class. I'm not the best at making 
        webistes or coding; however, that's why I'm here to learn. When creating projects  
        I get lots of inspiration from the things around me. Normally I use:
        <ul>
        <li>My dogs</li>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Art</li>
        <li>Films</li>
        <li>Makeup</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <div class="parallax"></div>
    <p>
        I can't even count how many projects I've created 
        using my dogs as the focus point, and I'm sure the cycle will continue throughout this class.
        Here they are for future reference. 
    </p>

    <h3>Gaming Memory</h3>
    <p>
        I have lots of different memories surrounding games. But one that stands out the most recently is 
        when my mom and I were playing Uno. But not just any type of Uno, Uno No Mercy. The game adds cards 
        to the classic game that make it nearly impossible to win. Of course there is a way, it just might take 
        a while. At one point I had about 30 cards in my hand; however, that allowed me to pick up a bunch of draw 10 
        cards. So I used a bunch of my wild draw cards, skips, and reverses all in a row. I thought it was funny, but I don't think
        my mom did. Oh well. Thats all a part of the game. I would highly recommend grabbing a copy of this version of Uno. 
        It was so much fun and I'm sure it would be more fun with more people.
