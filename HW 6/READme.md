Mine: This assignment was more challenging than I thought it would be. However, I found it wasn't from building the code, but from over looking small details. After building the code, I ran into a few problems. I troubleshooted these problems by comparing what I made to the example code provided. Made some changes, and nothing changed. I thought I had all my code right then, but my images weren't showing up. I then went to ChatGPT to see if it had any ideas. I attempted to troubleshoot, and still nothing. I had just about given up until I decided to look over it one more time. First, I found that one of my variables was miss labeld in two different sections ?(no wonder some of my "blank" image wasn't showing up). Then the photos I chose also weren't showing up. So I asked the AI to see if I was missing anything, becuase I was so lost and didn't see any other mistakes. It then spotted three small missed details in the code that should've been so obvious. Now my site works, and I didn't give up on the assignment before turning it in. This is the one time I will be thanking AI.
AI: ChaptGPTs code seems to work ok. It got all the images to load in; however, it didn't duplicate the images into pairs.
